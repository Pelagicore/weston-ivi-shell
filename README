# README file for the ivi-shell addon:

The ivi-shell proposes two features;

- A common layout library for surfaces, which allows the ivi-shell
  developer to create their own shell linking against the common
  layout library. Currently this library refers to the GENIVI ILM
  interface.

- An extension protocol; This protocol allows an ivi-application to tie
  wl_surface to a given ID.  With this ID, the shell can identify
  which wl_surface is drawn by which application. In an in-vehicle
  infortainment system, a shell has to update a property of a
  wl_surface. E.g. there may be a use case when vehicle starts to
  move, the wl_surface drawn by Car navigation is expected to move to
  top of the surface layers.

Weston

Weston is the reference compositor implementation of the Wayland
protocol, and a useful compositor in its own right.  Weston has
various backends that allows it run on Linux kernel modesetting and
evdev input as well as under X11. Weston ships with a few example
clients, from simple clients that demonstrate certain aspects of the
protocol to more complete clients and a simplistic toolkit.  There is
also a quite capable terminal emulator (weston-terminal) and an
toy/example desktop shell. Finally, Weston also provides integration
with the Xorg server and can pull X clients into the Wayland desktop
and act as a X window manager.

Refer to http://wayland.freedesktop.org/building.html for building
Weston and its dependencies.
